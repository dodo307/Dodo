### Contributing
Dodo follows a slightly reduced version of the [Airbnb](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) ReactJS coding standard. In-editor plugins like Prettier for VSCode can be optionally be used,
though linting and prettier can be executed through the terminal using the following npm commands:
- linting: `npm run lint`
- prettier check: `npm run prettier`
- prettier fix: `npm run format`

### Dev Setup
First check if Node and npm are installed using `node -v` and `npm -v` respectively. \
Then begin the backend with `npm start` and the frontend with `npm run dev`. \
You can now access the app through `localhost: 3000`
